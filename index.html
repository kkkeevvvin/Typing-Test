      "Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by
      that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day, you put
      all the work in, and eventually it'll pay off. It could be in a year, it
      could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off." - Kevin
      Hart
